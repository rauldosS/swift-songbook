<b>[Verse 1]</b>
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top ros√©, that's how"
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with

Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was

So scarlet, it was maroon

Sobbing with your head in your hands

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me

So scarlet, it was maroon
